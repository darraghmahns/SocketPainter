# SocketPainter
## SocketPainter project completed while in Systems Programming during my Spring Quarter of my senior year while at DU.

#### This project was the final project for this class. The goal was to create a GUI that you could open multiple windows of and draw different shapes all on the same "board." In other words, when users open a window (by running the program with different terminal sessions) they can draw shapes together and also send chat between each other using sockets to connect.

#### This project is written in Java. 

#### Full Credit was received. Thanks for checking it out!
